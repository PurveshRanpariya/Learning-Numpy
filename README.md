# 🔢 NumPy Learning Journey 🚀  

Hi! I’m **Purvesh Ranpariya**, a **B.Tech CSE student (2026 batch)** with a deep interest in **Python programming, data analysis, and problem-solving**.  

This repository captures my personal journey of exploring **NumPy**, the backbone of numerical computing in Python. Along the way, I’ve practiced with hands-on problems, datasets, and stage-wise challenges to strengthen my analytical skills.  

---

## 🌟 What I Learned in NumPy  
- Creating arrays using `np.array`, `np.arange`, `np.linspace`  
- Indexing, slicing, and subsetting arrays (1D, 2D, multi-dimensional)  
- Conditional filtering and boolean indexing (`arr[arr > value]`, `np.where`)  
- Aggregations & statistics: `sum()`, `mean()`, `min()`, `max()`, `argmax()`, `argmin()`  
- Array reshaping, flattening, and transposing  
- Vectorized operations for performance  
- Stage-based learning: **Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Challenges**  
- Practical dataset analysis (Employee, Sales, Finance use-cases)  

---

## 💻 Practice & Mini-Projects  
- **Employee Dataset Analysis** → Age filtering, salary insights, departmental comparisons  
- **Sales Data Exploration** → Identifying top sales, trends, and outliers  
- **Challenge Problems** → Applying NumPy functions to solve real-world style problems  

### 📝 Sample Tasks  
- Find employees with `Age > 30`  
- Extract salaries by `Department`  
- Identify the **top 2 highest salaries**  
- Apply boolean selection for conditional queries  
- Reshape and aggregate arrays for analysis

## ✨ About This Repo  
This repository by **Purvesh Ranpariya** is not just notes — it’s a **learning diary** of how I practiced, failed, and improved while exploring NumPy.  

⭐ It will continue to grow as I add **new challenges, datasets, and project-style exercises** to strengthen my data analysis skills.
